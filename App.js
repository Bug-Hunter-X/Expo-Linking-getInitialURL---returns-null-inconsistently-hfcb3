This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL()` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This is inconsistent and makes it difficult to reliably handle initial app startup based on deep links.  This often manifests when the app is launched directly from a deep link rather than from the home screen.
